## Introduction 

Digital Humanities (DH) is an interdisciplinary field that merges traditional humanities disciplines such as literature, history, philosophy, and cultural studies with computational methods and digital technologies. The field leverages the power of digital tools and methodologies to analyze, interpret, and visualize humanities data, offering new insights and perspectives on age-old questions. 

Coding for humanities, a crucial aspect of digital humanities, involves using programming languages and software to process and analyze humanities data. This approach not only enhances the efficiency and scope of research but also democratizes access to sophisticated analytical techniques.

As a student intrigued by the intersection of humanities and technology, exploring the potential of coding within the realm of digital humanities offers a unique opportunity to contribute to this evolving field. By applying advanced computational methods to traditional humanities questions, we can unlock new dimensions of understanding and address contemporary social issues with greater depth and clarity.


## Data and Visualization of Interest
The topic of applying advanced machine learning methods to predict poverty in Somalia interests me because it combines cutting-edge technology with critical social issues. As a student fascinated by the intersection of humanities and technology, I am particularly drawn to how machine learning (ML) can uncover hidden patterns and provide deeper insights into complex socio-economic phenomena like poverty. The potential of these techniques to identify key determinants of poverty and enhance the effectiveness of policy interventions is incredibly valuable, especially in regions facing significant data scarcity and economic challenges.

One specific study that caught my attention is the "Machine Learning Study Using 2020 SDHS Data to Determine Poverty Determinants in Somalia." The study employs ML techniques to analyze the 2020 Somalia Demographic and Health Survey (SDHS) data, aiming to pinpoint the critical factors contributing to poverty in the region.

I appreciate the correlation plot from this study because it effectively visualizes the relationships between multiple variables, making it easier to identify strong correlations and potential multicollinearity issues. This type of correlation plot is highly informative, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the data's structure and helps in selecting the most relevant predictors for further analysis. To create a similar correlation plot using Python, libraries such as seaborn, matplotlib, and pandas can be used for data manipulation and visualization.

## More Ideas for Data to Investigate
### Impact of Social Media on Mental Health
The influence of social media on mental health is a pressing issue in today's digital age. Investigating this topic can shed light on how different social media platforms impact mental well-being and help identify potential interventions to mitigate negative effects.

### The Role of Technology in Modern Education
Exploring how technology has transformed modern education systems can provide insights into its benefits and challenges. This research can help in understanding the effectiveness of various technological tools and platforms in enhancing educational outcomes.

### Digital Preservation of Cultural Heritage
The digital preservation of cultural heritage involves using technology to protect and maintain cultural artifacts and traditions. This topic is crucial for ensuring that cultural heritage is accessible to future generations, despite the challenges posed by time and environmental factors.
