# DH140 Final Project

Interactive Notebook: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/atirumal/DH140-Final-Project/main)

## Final Project

This project aims to explore public sentiment towards climate action using social media data, specifically tweets. By leveraging sentiment analysis techniques, I seek to understand how people feel about climate-related topics and how these sentiments have evolved over time. The central question driving this research is: **"How has public sentiment towards climate action changed over the years, and what factors influence these sentiments?"** 

I will analyze the sentiment expressed in tweets to uncover trends, patterns, and shifts in public opinion. Through various visualizations and statistical analyses, this project will provide insights into the collective mood towards climate action and potentially highlight key moments and topics that have significantly impacted public sentiment.

#### Other Considered Questions

Initially, I had considered several other questions for this project:
- **"What are the most discussed topics related to climate action on social media?"**
- **"How do major climate-related events influence public sentiment on social media?"**
- **"Is there a correlation between the sentiment of tweets and the engagement they receive (likes, retweets)?"**
- **"How does sentiment towards climate action vary across different geographic regions?"**

Ultimately, I narrowed it down to the central question of how public sentiment towards climate action has changed over time and the factors influencing these sentiments. This decision was made because understanding the evolution of sentiment provides a comprehensive view of public opinion trends and helps identify key moments that have shaped the discourse. Additionally, this question aligns well with the capabilities of sentiment analysis and offers clear, actionable insights for policymakers, activists, and researchers interested in climate action.


## Previous Ideas
These are previous ideas that I had, which explore the intersection of technology and social issues. However, I chose not to use them because they either required data that was difficult to access, had been extensively researched already, or did not align perfectly with my current research interests and available resources.

### Data and Visualization of Interest
The topic of applying advanced machine learning methods to predict poverty in Somalia interests me because it combines cutting-edge technology with critical social issues. As a student fascinated by the intersection of humanities and technology, I am particularly drawn to how machine learning (ML) can uncover hidden patterns and provide deeper insights into complex socio-economic phenomena like poverty. The potential of these techniques to identify key determinants of poverty and enhance the effectiveness of policy interventions is incredibly valuable, especially in regions facing significant data scarcity and economic challenges.

One specific study that caught my attention is the "Machine Learning Study Using 2020 SDHS Data to Determine Poverty Determinants in Somalia." The study employs ML techniques to analyze the 2020 Somalia Demographic and Health Survey (SDHS) data, aiming to pinpoint the critical factors contributing to poverty in the region.

I appreciate the correlation plot from this study because it effectively visualizes the relationships between multiple variables, making it easier to identify strong correlations and potential multicollinearity issues. This type of correlation plot is highly informative, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the data's structure and helps in selecting the most relevant predictors for further analysis. To create a similar correlation plot using Python, libraries such as seaborn, matplotlib, and pandas can be used for data manipulation and visualization.

## More Ideas for Data to Investigate
### Impact of Social Media on Mental Health
The influence of social media on mental health is a pressing issue in today's digital age. Investigating this topic can shed light on how different social media platforms impact mental well-being and help identify potential interventions to mitigate negative effects.

### The Role of Technology in Modern Education
Exploring how technology has transformed modern education systems can provide insights into its benefits and challenges. This research can help in understanding the effectiveness of various technological tools and platforms in enhancing educational outcomes.

### Digital Preservation of Cultural Heritage
The digital preservation of cultural heritage involves using technology to protect and maintain cultural artifacts and traditions. This topic is crucial for ensuring that cultural heritage is accessible to future generations, despite the challenges posed by time and environmental factors.
